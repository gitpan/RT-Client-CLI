NAME
    RT::Client::CLI - Provides the official rt command line client

SYNOPSIS
    See rt.

DESCRIPTION
    RT::Client::CLI is a CPAN-ready package for the rt command-line program
    that interacts with RT <https://bestpractical.com/rt>.

    No code is changed from the program shipped with RT. This is just an
    easy-to- install package when you want the rt program on another
    computer.

    The version of this package is kept in lockstep with the corresponding
    RT version from which the included rt was extracted.
